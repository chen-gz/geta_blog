## About Me

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Guangzong Chen, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic journey began at the Beijing Institute of Technology, where I earned my B.S. in Automation in 2019.
<!--
### Academic Background

I embarked on my Ph.D. journey in 2019, diving deep into the world of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research has primarily focused on innovative applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and neural networks, especially in the field of food image processing. My work on constrained food image generation and classification has been a thrilling exploration of how technology can intersect with everyday life, making significant strides in automatic dietary assessment and identifying diverse cuisines.

### Research and Projects

As a Research Assistant at the University of Pittsburgh since January 2020, I've had the privilege to work on groundbreaking projects. One of my notable projects involves designing a generative model utilizing GANs to manipulate food images, ensuring the preservation of the image shape while altering the food content. This project achieved an impressive mean squared error (MSE) of Intersection over Union (IoU) reaching 93% or higher.

In another exciting project, I developed a food image classification system tailored for small and uncommon food images from Africa. By leveraging probabilistic inference, SVM, and neural networks, I achieved a 90% accuracy in classification, showcasing the system's capability to effectively identify African cuisines.

My research also delves into the realm of Explainable AI through framelet-based mathematical methods to analyze neural network models. This work aims to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of neural networks, enabling the design of simpler networks with the same functionality as larger ones.

### Professional Experience

In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained valuable industry experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Nimbus Robotics. During my internship from April 2020 to August 2020, I worked on the full software development lifecycle, focusing on designing scalable systems, writing high-quality code, and ensuring thorough testing and validation. One of my key contributions was collaborating on the design and development of a Git-based version control system to support concurrent hardware driver development, improving workflow efficiency by approximately 20%.

### Personal Interests

When I'm not immersed in research or coding, I enjoy [mention any hobbies or interests you have, e.g., hiking, reading, cooking, etc.]. These activities help me stay balanced and inspired, fueling my creativity and passion for technology.

Thank you for visiting my blog! I'm excited to share my journey, insights, and projects with you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!
