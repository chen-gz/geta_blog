## About Me

Hello! I'm Guangzong Chen, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I hold a B.S. in Automation from the Beijing Institute of Technology.

### Research and Experience

As a Research Assistant at the University of Pittsburgh, I have worked on innovative projects such as:

- **Constrained Food Image Generation:** Developed a generative model using GANs for automatic dietary assessment, achieving over 93% IoU.
- **Food Image Classification:** Created a system for classifying African food images with 90% accuracy using probabilistic inference, SVM, and neural networks.
- **Neural Network Analysis:** Investigated framelet-based mathematical methods for enhanced explainability in AI.

During my internship at Nimbus Robotics, I contributed to:

- **Motor Controller Development:** Designed a motor controller using Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for wearable devices.
- **Version Control System:** Collaborated on a Git-based system improving workflow efficiency by ~20%.

### Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** C/C++, Python, MATLAB, Rust
- **Specialties:** Embedded Systems, Algorithms, RTOS, Circuit Design, Communication Protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, USB, eMMC)

### Publications

- "Shape-Preserving Generation of Food Images for Automatic Dietary Assessment," CVPR, 2024.
- “Image-based volume estimation for food in a bowl,” Journal of Food Engineering, Jul. 2024.
- “Improved Wearable Devices for Dietary Assessment Using a New Camera System,” Sensors, Oct. 2022.
- “Food/Non-Food Classification of Real-Life Egocentric Images in Low- and Middle-Income Countries Based on Image Tagging Features,” Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, Apr. 2021.

### Personal Projects

- **Serial Communication Tool:** Developed a tool using Rust for USART communication with superior stability and speed.
- **STM32 HAL Development:** Designed a user-friendly hardware abstraction layer in Rust for motor controllers.
